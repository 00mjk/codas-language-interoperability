# For the day of the tutorial

The talk is in [presentation.pdf](https://github.com/jpivarski/codas-language-interoperability/raw/master/presentation.pdf), which points to mini-notebooks (`*.ipynb`) along the way.

These require many dependencies, so we will use one of 50 prepared machines. You will just point your browser to that machineâ€” no ssh, no port forwarding, and no installation. I will give out URLs to those machines on the day of the tutorial.

# After the day of the tutorial

I will shut down all the machines after the tutorial is over, but if you want to run it on your own, you can do so by loading the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) AMI:

   * Launch an Amazon instance using image `ami-cbc5c9dd` and machine type `g2.2xlarge`, making sure that port 8888 is open.
   * You don't need to ssh into it: Jupyter is automatically loaded.
   * Point your web browser to `http://IP-ADDRESS:8888` and enter the password. After the day of the tutorial, I will post the password here.
   * If you want to ssh into it, the username is `ubuntu`, but that is not necessary.
